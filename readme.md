# About this repository:

- Welcome to my data analysis repository. Here are some of my basic portifolio projects related to data analysis.

- The programming language chosen for the project is [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.12.1.

- The IDE used is VS Code with the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension, which requires the installation of the package `ipykernel`. 

# Instructions:

- Use the command `python -m venv nome_do_ambiente_virtual` to create the virtual environment for the application.

- The ideal is to use the command `python -m venv env` because all directories named `env` will already be ignored by `git`.

- Activate the virtual environment with the command `.\env\Scripts\activate` after creating it.

- Install all the necessary libraries and frameworks with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` once the virtual environment has been activated.

- Read the `readme.md` files in each application and they will guide you through how to set up and run the apps individually.
